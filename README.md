## Apps

### anchor

This is a Solana program written in Rust using the Anchor framework.

#### Commands

You can use any normal anchor commands. Either move to the `anchor` directory and run the `anchor` command or prefix the command with `pnpm`, eg: `pnpm anchor`.

#### Sync the program id:

Running this command will create a new keypair in the `anchor/target/deploy` directory and save the address to the Anchor config file and update the `declare_id!` macro in the `./src/lib.rs` file of the program. This will also update the constant in `anchor/src/basic-exports.ts` file.

```shell
pnpm run setup
```

#### Build the program:

```shell
pnpm anchor-build
```

#### Start the test validator with the program deployed:

```shell
pnpm anchor-localnet
```

#### Run the tests

```shell
pnpm anchor-test
```

#### Deploy to Devnet

```shell
pnpm anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```
