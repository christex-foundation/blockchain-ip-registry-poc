   - Create comprehensive test suite for smart contract
   - Deploy and test on Devnet

2. **API Integration** (Medium Priority)
   - Connect existing royalty API to Anchor program
   - Replace mock transactions with real Solana operations
   - Add transaction monitoring and retry logic

3. **UI Completion** (Low Priority)
